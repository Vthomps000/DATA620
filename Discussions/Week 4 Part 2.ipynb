    "As an avid amazon shopper, I find a lot of the amazon review notebooks interesting. Here is an example of a notebook I enjoy : https://www.kaggle.com/shashanksai/text-preprocessing-using-python . The dataset contains user reviews of Amazon Fine Foods. It would be nice to see individual product ratings developed based on sentiment from the user reviews. I often find free datasets on Google Datasets. However, they rarely include notebooks. I have competed on kaggle, and I know there are quite a few kernels on various datasets. I simply searched for some notebooks on Amazon."
