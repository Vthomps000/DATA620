    "Your task in this week’s assignment is to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.  As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying your data source, you should create a high level plan that describes how you would load the data for analysis, and describe a hypothetical outcome that could be predicted from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups. "

    "I would like to investigate the social networks of characters found in movies. These character networks exhibit many of the properties of complex networks such as centrality measures, community sructure, and degree distribution. In these social networks networks, nodes represent characters. The edges between characters are determined by their interactions within the movie. Figures represent communities, that can be found by the network parameter  modularity. Centrality measures like PageRank and betweeness can find the top characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these character social networks, the nodes and edges correspond to some kind of social interaction such as friendship,  following, or perhaps, mirrors how writers create the social networks for their characters. For instance, a writer may chooses top characters in their books, and then built the network of lesser characters around them."

I will graph network data, and provide descriptive statistics on measures such as clustering coefficient, degree, density, diameter, modularity, average path length, the total number of edges, and the total number of nodes. Then, parse and determined same-scene appereance of characters as a proxy of connectedness (each co-appeareance is measured as one degree unit per scene). "
